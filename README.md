## Project Exam: Build a Foodie Website
You have been tasked with creating a website called Good Food Mood which helps people to find recipes. The site is aimed at working people who are interested in eating healthy and interesting food, but don't have a lot of time to read recipe books. The site should feel fun and engaging for
users and guide them to take action. Using an API, allow users to input ingredients (and perhaps any dietary concerns) and get back a list
of recipes. The site should also encourage them to sign up for a weekly newsletter with featured recipes. 

## Brief
-	Create a website for Good Food Mood that appeals to working professionals who are interested in healthy, tasty, and interesting food.
-	Use APIs to create interactive pages. You can find various free and open food-related APIs. Find one that suits you best.
-	The site should include a minimum of 4 pages, be responsive, and function well on a variety of platforms.
-	The site should employ JavaScript/JSON API for dynamic data and construction and styling of
HTML/CSS.
-	A contact form with JavaScript validation is required.
-	The site should be well-designed and easy to use and conform to WCAG standards.
-	A Git repository should be set up specifically for this project.
-	A report explaining the process and decisions made.

### Deliverables/Milestones
-	Report with link to completed microsite, as well as a link to your Git repository.
-	ZIP file containing all web files (HTML, CSS, JS).

**NB:** Formats other than PDF (Word, RTF, etc) will not be accepted. The file should be named using the standard date-assignment-name format. Failure to comply to both of these requirements will result in the assignment not being evaluated.
